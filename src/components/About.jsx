        <p>
          “I have studied Computer Science at Baku State University and focused
          on full-stack web development. I have gained hands-on experience by
          working on real projects using React, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js,
          and MongoDB. My projects include an e-commerce application, a hotel
          reservation system, and several portfolio-based websites. I place
          great importance on writing clean code, maintaining structured
          architecture, and building solutions that meet real business needs. I
          work on modern and innovative projects, and I also have several
          real-world projects. Additionally, I continuously improve myself and
          stay up to date with modern technologies.U.R”
